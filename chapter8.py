Write a program that creates a 10Ã—10 list of random integers between 1 and 100. Then do the following: (a) Print the list. (b) Find the largest value in the third row. (c) Find the smallest value in the sixth column'''

Here is an old puzzle question you can solve with a computer program. There is only one f ive-digit number n that is such that every one of the following ten numbers shares exactly one digit in common in the same position as n. Find n'''
